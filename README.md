# ConvertWithMe

## WORK IN PROGRESS

A simple WPF application that takes the cumbersome task of converting videos and audio files for you using the ffmpeg library. The most common formats and codecs are now hidden beneath a sleek UI which follows the M3 design guidelines. For the sake of me and the user only a very small subset of ffmpeg features, codecs and formats have been selected to work with this application. These however should cover most of the mundane tasks that one can ask ffmpeg to do. Tasks mundane enough that the commands are neither remembered, nor written down by the user and hence googled once more.
